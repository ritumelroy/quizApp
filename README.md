# TL;DR

I wanted to challenge myself and make this project without any external libraries or frameworks. The idea was that I would get to mess around with React more. Therefore, the aftereffect of this challenge was a deeper appreciation for external libs/frameworks. Can't wait to use tailwindCSS in my next project üòµ‚Äçüí´

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this simple project I feel like I got a better understanding of React hooks and when to use them. Earlier I was slightly still confused when to use useEffect & useRef. I think I have a better grasp of React now.

### Continued development

For my next project(s) I want to try working with external libraries more. I want to use TailwindCSS and ChakraUI. I already am familiar with Bootstrap and MantineUI, so I wish to try these. Although I have used Tailwind before I'm excited to apply it to a bigger project.
I also want to use more of NextJS for server side.

### Useful resources

- [Toggle Button resource](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - I wanted to keep this project simple without external libraries. So I needed some help making the toggle button from scratch and looked it up from here.
